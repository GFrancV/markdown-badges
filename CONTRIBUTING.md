## Good Practices

- Check the open issues before opening a PR, if you think you can solve it and there are no other PR already open, use `#issue-number` in your commit so that it is added to the issue. It doesn't hurt to leave a comment so that it is known which PR is being used for the issue.
- See if any PR is already open for the same issue, if so, try to help in the review process, comments or or bringing changes.
- Keep your commits clean and descriptive using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) pattern to commit your changes.
- Follow the project's code conventions.
- Install the recommended vscode extensions to help you with the code conventions.
